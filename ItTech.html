									<h2>Lead and User Interface Designer</h2>
									<p>Louisa fell into this role quite seamlessly. Since her project idea was used for the creation of this assignment, the group felt it only fitting for her main ideas to come to life, for she was the one that had the most information on the subject. Louisa took the low-fidelity designs from Lachlan, gave them some colour, made them fit the car park's victoria logo she created and made them aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.</p>
									<p></p>	She also formatted the document, led the team in what she wanted each of us to do, was extremely supportive of everyone and allowed all ideas to come to life, as a team.</p>
									<p>The logo created was made using looka.com, a free logo making website software, which was then adapted into different colourways and sizes.

									<h2>User Interface Designer	</h2>
									<p>Lachlan initiated the base of the user interface design that Louisa used within the high fidelity wireframe mockup. His paper designs were detailed and extremely helpful to give Louisa some assistance when creating the application from scratch. He outlined everything that he had hoped for the wireframe and the project, aiming to make the app as user friendly as possible.</p>

									<h2>Lead Website Developer</h2>
									<p>Muhammad took this role, having developed our assignment two website, taking the whole team by surprise, going above and beyond what we had asked of him. He formatted the whole of the report website and its design, implementing all work contributed by the group, as well as making an application section specifically for this assignment.</p>
																	
									<h2>Lead Programmer / Technical Designer</h2>
									<p>Our Lead programmer and the person behind the app's actual creation and functionality is James. He really took on the most difficult part of the whole project, however his experience with coding applications amongst other things in his spare time prove that he could do it. He again took this role quite naturally being the strongest programmer in the group.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>
<p>Our roles did not change throughout the assignment, as we each knew what our strengths were and we all stuck to those, as well as offering support or advice to others and adding in our input wherever it was needed. We would not say we particularly defined these roles at the start of the assignment, or for that matter throughout the creation of the app, however certain characteristics of each of the group members fell under a few roles that we knew the names of and henceforth names for our roles blossomed. We all worked particularly well together to facilitate and help each other, and in that instance our roles almost overlapped at some points. For example, Mohummad and James occasionally swapped roles, helping each other with coding and website development, whilst Lachlan stuck to his paper wireframe, and Louisa to the higher-fidelity mockup.
