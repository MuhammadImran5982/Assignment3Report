										<h2>Week One (1st May - 8th May)</h2>
										<p>What was planned: Add all requirements to a report document and go through the assignment requirements with the group.</p>
										<p>	What actually happened:</p>
										<p>Louisa formatted the basis of the report without any information, went over it herself as she was one of the only ones that attended the practical. Wrote in any sections that she did not understand.
											</p>
										<h2>	Week Two (9th May - 15th May)</h2>
										<p>	What was planned: </p>
											<p>Do the starting work, including adding your own information from assignment 2 into the next assignment.</p>
											<p>Planning out what was required of each team member to be completed, especially regarding the project description.</p>
										<p>	Aims, Roles, Planning & Progress - Louisa</p>
										<p>	Topic, Motivation, Landscape - Lachlan</p>
										<p>		Scopes and Limits, Timeframes, Group Processes and communication - James</p>
										<p>		Tools and Technologies, Testing, Risks - Muhammad</p>
										<p>		What actually happened:</p>
										<p>		<span class="image left"><img src="images/ss Plans n Progress.png" alt="" /></span>The group evenly distributed tasks and responsibilities, everyone had their own tasks to do, especially for the main part of the report, being the project description. Everything else, the group decided, would be done together or by whoever had the time. Louisa communicated with the rest of her team that she had started formatting the document and added everyone to it. Group made a pledge to communicate with one another, efficiently and effectively. Lachlan communicated that he had already created some sketches of the paper wireframe included here. The group talked about what software should be used for creating the application and the wireframe.
										</p>
										<h2>Week Three (16th May - 22nd May)</h2>
										<p>What was planned:</p>
											<p>Deciphering who would be creating the application, getting started on the high fidelity wireframe, the website and everything that's left.</p>
											<p>What actually happened:</p>
											<p>Muhammad said he would be in charge of the website.</p>
											<p>James said he would be in charge of the application</p>
											<p>Louisa said she would be in charge of the creation of the high fidelity mockup and asked for Lachlans assistance.</p>
											<p>Louisa, James and Muhammad all made a start on their said contributions.</p>
											<p>Everyone made contributions to report status, however not everyone contributed equally.</p>
											<p>Lachlan did not assist with the creation of the wireframe as he had little experience using Figma.</p>
											<h2>Week Four (23rd May - 29th May)</h2>
										<p>What was planned:</p>
										<p>Finalising the project, last minute touches, submitting work.</p>
											<p>Meeting with Anthony regarding our progress
											</p>
										<p>What actually happened:</p>
										<p>Meeting with Anthony on Thursday 2th of May - we went over the progress we had all made.</p>
										<p>Last minute additions to the project that had not been added previously by the group.</p>
										<p>Finalising all wireframes, adding in work to the report, formatting report, adding images, completing meeting pages.</p>
										<p>James finished as much as he could on the coding spectrum, including creating the homepage of the application.</p>
										
										<h2>Progress</h2>
										<p>Formatting the document</p>
										<p>Louisa has formatted the document on everyoneâ€™s behalf, including items from the last assignment. Proof-reading work, adding in images where required, links where necessary.</p>
										<p>Wireframe</p>
										<p>Louisa has completed the wireframe in as much detail as possible. She did not go into the extreme ins and outs of what would be on the app in terms of things that were out of her control. This included sections that needed data, information, maps.</p>
										<p>Website</p>
										<p>Muhammad Took his role seriously and tried his best to make a website which is both aestheically and physically functional as well as covering all the material that is required to be put in it. Muhammad has gone ahead and created 2 Websites one for the application and one for the report material. </p>
