									<h2>Team Name</h2>
										<p>Welcome to Team RDC’s I.T World report! Our team, RDC (standing for Research and Development of Carparks), is a group of passionate first year Information Technology students coming from many different backgrounds but all with a collective love for all things tech. Within our report, we hope to demonstrate a deep understanding of a wide range of different aspects within the IT world, as well as propose our solution to finding available parking at car parks across the Victorian metro area, hence our name! Our project is no ordinary Carpark app, but has a huge emphasis on the availability of parking at nearby train stations. The idea sparked from one of our team members who had no choice but to get a fine as the parking at their nearby train station was extremely full and they needed to get to university.
											Before we get to our research and plans to solve this issue, a little bit about our team members.
										</p>
									<h2>Group Processes</h2>
									<section>
										<p>Group RDC did not work as a ‘group’ in assessment two. Since then, we have lost a team member. Throughout the entirety of the last assignment, the majority of the group lacked communication, consistency and failed to submit their work to the group when required. This resulted in work being hauled together extremely last minute, putting strain on the group members that had already completed and conducted their work. In turn, one member of the group called on the lecturer to urgently ask the rest of the group to make their status known. This put a further strain on the group. Towards the end of the assignment, work was submitted, but it was definitely not work that was completed to the best of our ability. Reflecting on the group dynamic after the assignment was handed in, the group as a whole decided that transparency was needed moving forward and that work needed to be completed in segments as asked by Louisa. Louisa took charge of the group, assigning herself with the task of creating the teams page, distributing tasks to be done with deadlines that rarely were met and, continually questioning and pushing her team members to contribute.
											For Assignment three, group RDC collectively decided that their effort in assignment two was simply not good enough, and that all of them would be contributing to the workload in a fairer manner, and that everyone would do their required work. The team member that left the team took the worries of the group and their tasks for assignment three were evenly distributed amongst the team, giving Louisa reassurance that the task at hand would be completed in a timely manner. From the last assessment, two members of the group, Muhammad and James, displayed their talents in website building and coding. These are definitely going to be useful when it comes to coding a functionable application and developing the website base. Louisa has a strong suit and passion for the formatting of the document and keeping everyone in line and this is super helpful to ensure everyone is staying on task and doing their work.
											Overall, RDC definitely believes that we can do better in our assignment 3 and will strive to complete this task to the best of our abilities.
											</p>
									<h2>Career Plans</h2>
									<p>For our group, we all plan on continuing along with our original career plans and career goals. Our work during assignment two has not only expanded our knowledge of what each of our dream jobs entail but has also made us hungrier to achieve our goals of working in our fields with our specialties. Louisa remains adamant on becoming a CTO, being driven by her overwhelming interest in new technology and ideas that she could potentially implement into her businesses one day. James continues to have a deep loving for coding and is currently more driven to become a software engineer than he ever was before. Muhammad remains adamant in becoming a cyber security analyst, finding the different patterns and trends in cyber security to be extremely interesting to him. Lachie still aims to be a lead developer, with his good person to person skills as well as his interest in the technical side of IT paving his way to make this happen.</p>
